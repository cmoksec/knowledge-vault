## **SSRF attacks against the server**

In an SSRF attack against the server, the attacker causes the application to make an HTTP request back to the server that is hosting the application, via its loopback network interface. This typically involves supplying a URL with a hostname like `127.0.0.1` (a reserved IP address that points to the loopback adapter) or `localhost` (a commonly used name for the same adapter).

For example, imagine a shopping application that lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. To provide the stock information, the application must query various back-end REST APIs. It does this by passing the URL to the relevant back-end API endpoint via a front-end HTTP request. When a user views the stock status for an item, their browser makes the following request:

```
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check%3FproductId%3D6%26storeId%3D1
```

This causes the server to make a request to the specified URL, retrieve the stock status, and return this to the user.

In this example, an attacker can modify the request to specify a URL local to the server:

```
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://localhost/admin
```

The server fetches the contents of the `/admin` URL and returns it to the user.

An attacker can visit the `/admin` URL, but the administrative functionality is normally only accessible to authenticated users. This means an attacker won't see anything of interest. However, if the request to the `/admin` URL comes from the local machine, the normal access controls are bypassed. The application grants full access to the administrative functionality, because the request appears to originate from a trusted location.

## **SSRF with blacklist-based input filters**

Some applications block input containing hostnames like `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, or sensitive URLs like `/admin`. In this situation, you can often circumvent the filter using the following techniques:

- Use an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`, such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, or `127.1`.
- Register your own domain name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.
- Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
- Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an `http:` to `https:` URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.

```bash
stockApi=http://127.1/Admin/delete?username=carlos
```

## SSRF with whitelist-based input filters

Some applications only allow inputs that match, a whitelist 
of permitted values. The filter may look for a match at the beginning of
 the input, or contained within in it. You may be able to bypass this 
filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.

The URL specification contains a number of features that are
 likely to be overlooked when URLs implement ad-hoc parsing and 
validation using this method:

- You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the `@` character. For example: `https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host`
- You can use the `#` character to indicate a URL fragment. For example: `https://evil-host#expected-host`
- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place
required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For
example: `https://expected-host.evil-host`
- You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the
filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that
performs the back-end HTTP request. You can also try double-encoding
characters; some servers recursively URL-decode the input they receive,
which can lead to further discrepancies.
- You can use combinations of these techniques together.

## How to find and exploit blind SSRF vulnerabilities

The most reliable way to detect blind SSRF vulnerabilities 
is using out-of-band (OAST) techniques. This involves attempting to 
trigger an HTTP request to an external system that you control, and 
monitoring for network interactions with that system.

The easiest and most effective way to use out-of-band 
techniques is using Burp Collaborator. You can use Burp Collaborator to 
generate unique domain names, send these in payloads to the application,
 and monitor for any interaction with those domains. If an incoming HTTP
 request is observed coming from the application, then it is vulnerable 
to SSRF.

### Note

It is common when testing for SSRF vulnerabilities to 
observe a DNS look-up for the supplied Collaborator domain, but no 
subsequent HTTP request. This typically happens because the application 
attempted to make an HTTP request to the domain, which caused the 
initial DNS lookup, but the actual HTTP request was blocked by 
network-level filtering. It is relatively common for infrastructure to 
allow outbound DNS traffic, since this is needed for so many purposes, 
but block HTTP connections to unexpected destinations.
