This is rather a cryptographic failure, since the generation algo is weak and only relies on time, but to exploit it, we need 2 parallel requests.

If we send 2 parallel requests for 2 different users, and they have synchronized time used for token generation, it basically means there will be one identical token issued for both users. Thatâ€™s how we can reach a password reset link for a victim account by using the same token (condition: username is not giving an entropy for the token generation and only treated as a parameter)

Note for below: requests are sent from different sessions using different CSRF tokens.
