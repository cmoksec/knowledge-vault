# Single Endpoint Race Condition

The website has a vulnerable change email function, and we know that the email address [`carlos@ginandjuice.shop`](mailto:carlos@ginandjuice.shop) has received the invitation for the admin access.

After a request to change an email address is sent, the confirmation letter is sent to the mailbox. However, with a race condition flaw, we can receive a confirmation link for another mail address on our mailbox. For that, we need to try sending 2 requests in parallel, one for our controlled email, other for victimâ€™s email.
