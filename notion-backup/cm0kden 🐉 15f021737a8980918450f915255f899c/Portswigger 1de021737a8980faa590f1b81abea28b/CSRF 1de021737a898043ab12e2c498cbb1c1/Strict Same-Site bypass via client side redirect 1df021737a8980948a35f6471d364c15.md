# Strict Same-Site bypass via client side redirect

To bypass Strict Same-site policy, the website must have a redirection vulnerability that will allow to make an arbitrary secondary request from a same-site scope (the website itself will send a request), thus a session cookie will be included into the request. Example from lab **SameSite Strict bypass via client-side redirect**

A website has a vulnerability in post comment confirmation page. It redirects using costId parameter (itâ€™s used to construct a redirection URL). Using it, we can tamper a postId parameter to redirect to any page in a same site scope.

As far as sensitive functionality works on GET method, we can redirect to the sensitive URL triggering the logic.
